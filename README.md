## Analyze A/B Test Results

### Introduction

> A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.   

> For this project, we will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.  The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.  

### According to results above, after looking at interaction between page and country, there does not seem to be any statistical evidence to indicate an impact on the conversion since p-values are all exceeding 0.05.**
